Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of newspaper.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.

Distribute & Pip
----------------

Installing newspaper is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.
However, you will run into fixable issues if you are trying to install on ubuntu.

**If you are not using ubuntu**, install with the following:

::

    $ pip install newspaper

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python2.7


**If you are**, install using the following:

::

    $ apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
    $ easy_install lxml # NOT PIP

    $ pip install newspaper 

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python2.7


It is also important to note that the line

::

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python2.7


is not needed unless you need the natural language, ``nlp()`` features like keywords extraction and summarization.

If you are using ubuntu and are still running into gcc compile errors when installing lxml, try installing
``libxslt1-dev`` instead of ``libxslt-dev``.

Get the Code
------------

Newspaper is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper>`_.

You can clone the public repository::

    git clone git://github.com/codelucas/newspaper.git

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package,
or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ python setup.py install
